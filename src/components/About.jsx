          As a Junior Front-End Developer, I'm proficient in HTML, CSS and
          JavaScript. I use libraries and frameworks like Tailwind, Bootstrap
          and React to maintain high quality, responsive and interactive web
          sites that offer a smooth user experience. I love when people put
          trust on me and I do my best to do their work with as high quality as
          possible. As it says "Quality is more important than quantity".
